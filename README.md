# module2DepositandWithdraw
# Smart-Contract-Project (Module 2)

This program is for creating a smart contract project by using withdraw and deposit functions with a front-end app

## Description

Avalanche is a blockchain platform that provides decentralized apps and blockchain networks. Avalanche is designed to address the scalability issues that have conventional blockchain systems. The platform offers exceptional transaction speed and finality in milliseconds because of the consensus protocol, Avalanche. The adaptable architecture of Avalanche complements this scalability by enabling developers to design customized blockchain networks, or subnets, that satisfy particular needs and use cases. 

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Visual Studio Code. 

Once you are on the Visual Studio Code, create a new file. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., project.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

//import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract Assessment {
    address payable public owner;
    uint256 public balance;

    event Deposit(uint256 amount);
    event Withdraw(uint256 amount);

    constructor(uint initBalance) payable {
        owner = payable(msg.sender);
        balance = initBalance;
    }

    function getBalance() public view returns(uint256){
        return balance;
    }

    function deposit(uint256 _amount) public payable {
        uint _previousBalance = balance;

        // make sure this is the owner
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not the owner of this account");

        // perform transaction
        balance += _amount;

        // assert transaction completed successfully
        assert(balance == _previousBalance + _amount);

        // emit the event
        emit Deposit(_amount);
    }

    // custom error
    error InsufficientBalance(uint256 balance, uint256 withdrawAmount);

    function withdraw(uint256 _withdrawAmount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not the owner of this account");
        uint _previousBalance = balance;
        if (balance < _withdrawAmount) {
            revert InsufficientBalance({
                balance: balance,
                withdrawAmount: _withdrawAmount
            });
        }

        // withdraw the given amount
        balance -= _withdrawAmount;

        // assert the balance is correct
        assert(balance == (_previousBalance - _withdrawAmount));

        // emit the event
        emit Withdraw(_withdrawAmount);
    }
}
